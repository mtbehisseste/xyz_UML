# XYZ UML Editor
A simple UML editor with basic objects (classes and use cases), and several types of relation lines (association, generation, composition). 
This is the term project of the course "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design"(2019, ncu).
The project is meant to practice for the object-oriented design including extension, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc. 
A good software design should try to seperate core code from GUI or unsolid part.
